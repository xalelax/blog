I'm Alessandro, a Senior Simulation Intelligence Engineer working at [Pasteur Labs](https://pasteurlabs.ai/).

I am a theoretical physicist by training, but I have been fascinated with technology
since my childhood. Computers, especially, have been my top interest
for a long time. 

My current work is in Machine Learning applied to scientific problems, including also the software engineering
needed to make it work smoothly.
