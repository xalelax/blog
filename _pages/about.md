[Curriculum Vitae](/cv.pdf)

I'm Alessandro, and this is my website.

I am a theoretical physicist, but I have been fascinated with technology
since my childhood. Computers, especially, have been my top interest
for a long time. I am extremely interested and have expertise in
Data Analysis and Visualization. My resume can be
found [here](/cv.pdf)

Lately I have been working with Machine Learning and
Data Science. I like Keras and Tensorflow,
and I'm experimenting with Arduino and IoT devices.
I code mostly in C/C++ and Python. 

I decided to start this blog to share with the world my views and the projects I am working on.

I hope you get something useful from it!
