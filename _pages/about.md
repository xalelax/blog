I'm Alessandro, a Quantum Software Engineer working at [ParityQC](https://parityqc.com/).

I am a theoretical physicist by training, but I have been fascinated with technology
since my childhood. Computers, especially, have been my top interest
for a long time. My current work lies at the intersection between 
physics and computer science, in the realm of Quantum Computing.
Aside from that, I worked as a data scientist, and continue cultivating this interest
in my spare time. 

I decided to start this blog to share with the world my views and the projects
I am working on; whomever you are, I hope you get something useful from it!
