I'm Alessandro, a Quantum Software Engineer working at [Paretos](https://www.paretos.com/).

I am a theoretical physicist by training, but I have been fascinated with technology
since my childhood. Computers, especially, have been my top interest
for a long time. 

My current work is mainly in statistics, time series forecasting, machine learning, and so on...
but I do have broad interests :-)
