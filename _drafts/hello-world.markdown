title:  "Hello, World!"

Hello everyone!

I am Alessandro, a PhD student in Theoretical Physics. Although I dedicate
most of my time studying a very specific topic (Quantum Electrodynamics),
I am curious about a broad range of topics. I decided to start this blog
because I want to share my ideas and my projects with the world, and
perhaps receive some feedback about what am I doing.

Most likely, the first project I will write about here is a sous-vide oven
which I am building starting from an Arduino and a rice cooker.
It is nothing extremely complex, but it is my first step in the
world of microcontrollers.

Stay tuned!
