Full disclosure, since for many people this is a delicate argument: **I am not religious** 
and I **do not** believe in anything supernatural. I will try to avoid strawmanning 
positions different from mine, but if I do I apologize in advance, and please let me know.

# Probabilities and Experiments

One way to define the probability of an event is to identify it as the limit of
the relative frequency of that event with respect to every possible outcome.

For instance, if a coin is thrown $$100$$ times and it lands $$57$$ times on heads,
the relative frequency of heads is $$57/100$$. In order to obtain the **probabilities**
associated with the throw of that coin, we need to calculate the limit of the relative
frequency of heads in $$N$$ throws as $$N$$ grows infinitely. For a "fair"
coin tossed in a "fair" way, we should find that the probability of
heads is $$P_H = 1/2$$.

This procedure makes sense mathematically,
but it leaves us with a problem: in order to know probabilities, we would
need to perform an infinite amount of experiments. Since at the end of the day
one can perform only a finite amount of experiments, people adopting this so-called "frequentist" 
interpretation of probabilities mostly work with objects such as estimators and confidence intervals
to extract as much information as possible from the finite number of samples one can obtain 
from experimental data.

Aside of the frequentist interpretation, there is another position which is held by many
scientists which is called Bayesian interpretation. 

# Bayes Theorem

# Probing the Paranormal with Experiments

How does all this relate to miracles and the supernatural? A lot of historians speculate
that Bayes and Price, both believers in Christianity (thus, in particular, in the 
miracle of the resurrection of Jesus), were assessing claims made by the greatest skeptic of their
time, David Hume.

In particular, in Section X of *An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding*, Hume writes:
>"No testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such 
> a kind, that its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact which it 
> endeavors to establish."
If we consider the resurrection of Jesus, we should ask ourselves
whether it is more likely that the reports we have of it are false with respect to 
the possibility that someone actually came back from the dead. Since we have many
examples of people lying or making up stories, and not really any example of people
resurrecting, according to Hume we cannot accept as evidence the testimony left to us 
regarding the resurrection.

Not being able to prove a miracle happened, however, is not the same as refuting it.
Bayes' theorem can be used to show that no number of negative observations (i.e.,
people dying and not resurrecting) can rule out a miracle; sure, every negative
observation will lower the posterior probability of the miracle, but never make it zero.
This can be easily seen by looking at what happens by repeated application of the
following formula:
%...

If we did not rule out a priori the possibility of a miracle by putting ..., no finite amount of data can
make ... equal to zero. 



# Conclusion

There is something rather remarkable in the way Bayesian inference ... and 
the way people reach their conclusions. In this post I presented only a few things,
but there are even more complex human behaviours (....) which can be beautifully
interpreted in a Bayesian fashion. Many (...) argued that Bayesian inference
is ... scientific method. Indeed, scientists more often than not build their set of
beliefs not really by performing experiments themselves

Conversely, regarding ordinary events, if somebody told me "I have a dog" he would be
reporting something not particularly rare; depending on how much I trust that person
(and the consequences that me believing him have) I could accept that claim without 
the need of further evidence. Of course, I think that most people would find the 
much more unlikely claim "I have a million dogs" difficult to believe by itself, 
even if it comes from a very close and trusted friend.
