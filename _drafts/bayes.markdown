One way to define the probability of an event is to identify it as the limit of
the relative frequency of that event with respect to every possible outcome.

For instance, if a coin is thrown $$100$$ times and it lands $$57$$ times on heads,
the relative frequency of heads is $$57/100$$. In order to obtain the **probabilities**
associated with the throw of that coin, we need to calculate the limit of the relative
frequency of heads in $$N$$ throws as $$N$$ grows infinitely. For a "fair"
coin tossed in a "fair" way, we should find that the probability of
heads is $$P_H = 1/2$$.

This procedure makes sense mathematically,
but it leaves us with a problem: in order to calculate probabilities, we would
need in general to perform an infinite amount of experiments. 

# Bayes' Theorem

The Bayes' theorem can be derived from the definition of conditional probabilities:
$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}
$$
