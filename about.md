Hi! 

I'm Alessandro Angioi, and this is my personal blog.

I am a theoretical physicist, but I have been fascinated with technology
since my childhood. Computers, especially, have been my top interest
for a long time.

I code mostly in C/C++ and Python, and I am currently learning Haskell and Javascript. 

I decided to start this blog to share with the world my views and the projects I am working on.

I hope you get something useful from it!
