Hi! 

I'm Alessandro, and this is my personal blog.

I am a theoretical physicist, but I have been fascinated with technology
since my childhood. Computers, especially, have been my top interest
for a long time. Lately I am playing around with Arduino, and experimenting
with IoT devices. I code mostly in C/C++ and Python. 

I decided to start this blog to share with the world my views and the projects I am working on.

I hope you get something useful from it!
