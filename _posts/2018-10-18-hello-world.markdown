Hello everyone!

I am Alessandro, a Theoretical Physicist currently based in Heidelberg, Germany.
Although during the last four years I dedicated most of my time studying a very
specific topic (Quantum Electrodynamics),
I am curious about a quite broad range of topics. I decided to start this blog
because I want to share my ideas and my projects with the world, and
receive some feedback about what I am doing.
I want this site to be my personal sketchbook/lab notebook, and I decided
to open it to everybody.

Most likely, one of the first projects I will write about here is a sous-vide oven
which I am building starting from an Arduino and a rice cooker.
It is nothing extremely complex, but it is my first step in the
world of microcontrollers and control theory.

Also, for now I am just using an extremely minimal theme for this website,
but I plan to change it into one designed by me very soon, and perhaps
write about that.

Stay tuned!
